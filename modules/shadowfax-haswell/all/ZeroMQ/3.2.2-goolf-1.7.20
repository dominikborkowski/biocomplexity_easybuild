    puts stderr { ZeroMQ looks like an embeddable networking library but acts like a concurrency framework.
It gives you sockets that carry atomic messages across various transports like in-process,
inter-process, TCP, and multicast. You can connect sockets N-to-N with patterns like fanout,
pub-sub, task distribution, and request-reply. It's fast enough to be the fabric for clustered
products. Its asynchronous I/O model gives you scalable multicore applications, built as asynchronous
message-processing tasks. It has a score of language APIs and runs on most operating systems. - Homepage: http://www.zeromq.org/
