 approach is the ability to account for both technical uncertainty and intrinsic biological 
 variance in order to avoid false DE calls. The technical contribution to the uncertainty comes 
 both from finite read-depth and the possibly ambiguous mapping of reads to multiple transcripts. - Homepage: https://github.com/BitSeq/BitSeq
