Description
===========
SOAPdenovo is a novel short-read assembly method that can build a 
 de novo draft assembly for human-sized genomes. The program is specially designed to 
 assemble Illumina short reads. It creates new opportunities for building reference 
 sequences and carrying out accurate analyses of unexplored genomes in a cost effective way. 
 SOAPdenovo2 is the successor of SOAPdenovo.
